# 🌍 Global Health & Development — Tableau Data Visualization Project

This project explores key global health and development indicators using a series of interactive Tableau dashboards. It visualizes trends across life expectancy, child mortality, education, healthcare investment, lifestyle factors, and more — using clean, structured data from multiple countries over time.

The goal of this project was to not only analyze the data but also design intuitive dashboards that tell a compelling visual story. It’s part of my data portfolio and showcases both technical Tableau skills and data storytelling.

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

This project includes four themed dashboards built with Tableau:

| Dashboard Title                 | Focus Areas                                       | Chart Types                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Life Expectancy Trends**     | Global trends, GDP correlation, country progress | Line chart, Bubble chart, Map       |
| **Child Health & Vaccinations**| Under-5 deaths, immunization coverage            | Line chart, Stacked bar chart       |
| **Lifestyle & Nutrition**      | Thinness, BMI, alcohol consumption               | Line chart, Scatter plot            |
| **Education, GDP & Health**    | Health investment, schooling, outcomes           | Scatter plot with trend lines       |

All dashboards feature global filters for **Year**, **Country**, and **Status** (e.g. Developing vs Developed).

## 🔧 How I Built It

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Reformatted date and numerical fields for Tableau compatibility
- Handled missing/null values
- Final dataset exported as a clean CSV file (`/data/global_health_cleaned.csv`)

### 2. Visualization Design
- Chose appropriate chart types for different relationships (e.g. trends, comparisons, geography)
- Created calculated fields and parameter filters in Tableau where needed
- Added tooltips, color encoding, and filters to enhance interactivity
- Used “Use as Filter” actions to make visual exploration more intuitive

### 3. Dashboard Structure
Each dashboard groups related worksheets into one interactive view with:
- Sidebar filters
- Clean layout and titles
- Dynamic legends and tooltips
- User-friendly interface for exploring relationships in the data
